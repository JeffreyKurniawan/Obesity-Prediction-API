# 🧑‍⚕️ Obesity Level Prediction System  

This project is a **machine learning model** trained on the **ObesityDataSet** to predict an individual’s **obesity level** based on lifestyle, health, and demographic features.  
It uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, served via **FastAPI**, and includes a **Streamlit UI** for user-friendly interaction.
